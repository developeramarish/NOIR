# NOIR E2E Test Plan

## 1. Overview

### Goals
- Verify critical user flows work end-to-end across all modules
- Catch regressions before they reach production
- Validate cross-module data integrity (e.g., winning a CRM lead auto-creates a customer)
- Ensure multi-tenant auth and permission enforcement work correctly

### Scope
- **In scope:** All portal modules (Auth, Dashboard, E-commerce [Products, Orders, Customers, Customer Groups, Reviews], Marketing [Promotions], CRM, HR, Admin, Blog, Inventory, PM, Notifications), cross-module data linking, permission enforcement
- **Out of scope:** Unit-level logic (covered by 11,700+ backend tests), visual regression (Storybook), performance benchmarks, third-party integrations (payment gateways, shipping providers)

### Approach
- **Page Object Model (POM):** Each page has a dedicated PO class in `e2e/pages/`
- **API-first data seeding:** Use `ApiHelper` to create test data via API (10-50x faster than UI setup)
- **Shared auth state:** Login once via `auth.setup.ts`, reuse `storageState` across all tests
- **Parallel execution:** Tests are independent and can run concurrently via `fullyParallel: true`
- **Deterministic cleanup:** Each test creates and cleans up its own data in `beforeAll`/`afterAll`

### Conventions
- Test IDs use `MODULE-NNN` format (e.g., `AUTH-001`, `ECOM-PROD-003`)
- Priority: **P0** = blocks release, **P1** = important regression, **P2** = nice-to-have coverage
- Tags: `@smoke` (every PR, <5min total), `@regression` (daily, <15min), `@nightly` (full suite, all browsers)
- Time estimates assume warm server; add 2-3s for first navigation due to lazy loading

---

## 2. Test Strategy

| Level | Trigger | Target Time | Browser(s) | Tag |
|-------|---------|-------------|------------|-----|
| **Smoke** | Every PR, pre-merge | <5 min | Chromium only | `@smoke` |
| **Regression** | Daily CI schedule | <15 min | Chromium only | `@regression` |
| **Nightly** | Nightly CI schedule | <30 min | Chromium + Firefox + WebKit + Mobile Chrome | `@nightly` |

### Smoke Suite (~25 tests, <5min)
All P0 tests: login, dashboard load, CRUD happy path for each module, key cross-module links.

### Regression Suite (~80 tests, <18min)
Smoke + P1 tests: validation errors, edge cases, bulk operations, search/filter, data linking.

### Nightly Suite (~102 tests, <30min)
All tests including P2: cross-browser, import/export, advanced workflows, permission enforcement.

### Data Isolation
- Each test file uses unique prefixes for created entities (e.g., `E2E-PROD-{timestamp}`)
- Tests clean up created data in `afterAll` or `afterEach`
- Tests do NOT depend on pre-existing seed data (except the default admin user)

## 5. Test Data Strategy

### Naming Convention
All test-created entities use the prefix `E2E-` or `E2E ` followed by a timestamp to ensure uniqueness:
- Products: `E2E Product 1709312345`
- Contacts: `e2e-contact-1709312345@test.com`
- Departments: `E2E Dept 1709312345`

### Seeding via API
Use `ApiHelper` for fast data setup:
```typescript
const api = new ApiHelper(request);
const product = await api.createProduct({ name: `E2E Product ${Date.now()}`, sku: `E2E-${Date.now()}` });
// ... run tests ...
await api.deleteProduct(product.id);
```

### Cleanup
- `afterAll` blocks delete all created entities
- Use `try/finally` to ensure cleanup runs even on test failure
- Cleanup order respects FK constraints (delete orders before customers, leads before contacts)
